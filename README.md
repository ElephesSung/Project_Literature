## Chapter 1. NK cell receptor coupling/cooperativity.

The literature folder is here: [Chapter1_folder](./Receptor_Team/)

> The question to be answered:
> - How the difference between flux and the concentration of the activating receptor influence the quantification of NK cell activation.
> - How the coupling or cooperativity between receptor influences the signalling and decision-making in NK cells.
> - How the inhibitory signalling pathway assist the decision-making and NK cell education.








<!-- ## Linking to a subfolder

You can link to folders and files in subfolders using relative Markdown links. Examples below assume this README sits at the repository root.

- Link to a folder (GitHub will show the directory listing):

	- `[Receptor_Team](./Receptor_Team/)`

- Link directly to a file inside the subfolder:

	- `[Hathcock et al. (2023) — PDF](./Receptor_Team/hathcock-et-al-2023-a-nonequilibrium-allosteric-model-for-receptor-kinase-complexes-the-role-of-energy-dissipation-in.pdf)`
	- `[mmc3.pdf](./Receptor_Team/mmc3.pdf)`

- If a filename contains spaces or special characters, URL-encode spaces as `%20` or wrap the target in angle brackets:

	- `[Example with space](./Receptor_Team/some%20file.pdf)` or `<./Receptor_Team/some file.pdf>`

- Use `../` to link up one directory level (useful when README is deeper in the tree).

Notes:

- Relative links like `./Receptor_Team/mmc3.pdf` work on GitHub and in most Markdown renderers.
- To link to the file view on a specific branch on GitHub use the full URL format:

	`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<branch>/Receptor_Team/mmc3.pdf`

- To link to a heading (anchor) in this README use the lowercase, hyphenated form of the heading, e.g. `[Receptor Coupling](#receptor-coupling-cooperativity-simulations)`
