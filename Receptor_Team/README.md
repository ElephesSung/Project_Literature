# NK cell receptor cooperativity.



> The question to be answered:
> - How the difference between flux and the concentration of the activating receptor influence the quantification of NK cell activation.
> - How the coupling or cooperativity between receptor influences the signalling and decision-making in NK cells.
> - How the inhibitory signalling pathway assist the decision-making and NK cell education.


**The content**
- Mathematical modelling of TCR discrimination: how the cooperativity enhances TCR discrimination (both specificity & sensitivity)

- One example publication on TCR  that we could take a reference

- NK cell cytotoxic decision-making VS TCR discrimination: similarities and difference.

- Current theoretical & experimental work on NK cell decision-making

> T-cell receptors (TCRs) recognise peptide–MHC (pMHC) complexes and discriminate foreign from self via peptide-dependent binding and signalling thresholds; agonist pMHC generally produce longer-lived interactions and stronger signals than self pMHC.
